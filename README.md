# Rust D3 Geo
Rust 2021 Edition.

This is a port  [d3-geo](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo) into RUST.

## Status
The majority of the libray has been ported along with the associated tests. The aim is to eventaully release this as a rust crate.
but at the moment is this alpha grade software.

<details>
<summary> Here is a list of thing to-do before the crate is published.</summary>

* The recenter state-based API refacor is almost complete.
  Once fit_size_resampling() is reinstated the code-coverage metric will jump 10% back to the previous value of approx 82%
* The clipping algorithm in clip/rejoin/mod.rs needs to be refactored.
see  [The intersection Problem.](#the-intersection-problem--request-for-comments)
Test coverage in that area is high so the algortihms is working but the data structures make extensive use of Vec<Options<Rc<RefCell<_Intersection_>>>> which is not performant.

* The API is not stabalised. If perfomance issues arise then the API will change. Additionaly I plan a final review to remove anything uneeded before making changes become complicated.

## Examples

In addition to the port, some examples are provided to help developers convert their existing javascript to rust.

| Name                  | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| examples/globe/canvas | Shows how to load/parse/display  a complex topojson file to a CANVAS element.                                                                |
| examples/globe/svg    | Shows how to load/parse/display the globe as indivdual SVG PATH elements. Useful when the semantic meaing of the data needs to be preserved. |
| examples/projections  | Shows a side by side comparison of the all the projections rendered by both javascript and rust.                                             |
| examples/graticule    | Show various ways of rendering latitide and longitude lines.                                                                                 |
| examples/ring         | Renders a complex multipolygon.                                                                                                              |
 ## Running the examples

<details>
<summary>See the details.</summary>

  From a machine with npm and node installed.

  First install wamm-pack [[ installation guide]](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/)
  ```
  cd rust_d3_geo/examples/ring/
  npm install
  npm start
  ```

## Benchmarking

<details>
<summary>See the details.</summary>
In this project, we have two benchmarks, based on the ring and graticule examples ( see above. )

Also [rust_d3_geo_voronoi](https://github.com/martinfrances107/rust_d3_geo_voronoi)
 uses this library, and thank project contains a benchmark which contains an exact port of a benchmark in [d3-geo-voronoi ](https://github.com/Fil/d3-geo-voronoi).
 Based on that benchmark rust is 31% faster, or permits a 37% increase in throughput.

## Future Multi thread support
<details>
<summary>See the details.</summary>
On my todo list.
* [rayon](https://docs.rs/rayon/latest/rayon/index.html) is rust's crate for multithread support.
I have made extensive use of iterators when porting the code and rayon support the easy conversion of single threaded iterators to multithread iterators.

* The Hashmaps - appear slow.
  Maybe I can get performace improvements by replacing them with B-tree collections?

## Archetecture discussion 

There is an aspect of the design that needs review. It related to the best way to implement a doubly-linked list which has cross links between nodes. A full discusion can be found [here](/intersection_problem.md)

<br>

## Unimplemented sections of the library.
<details>
<summary>See the details.</summary>
Support for a custom projection is not yet supported.
For an example of this see the test labelled "projection.fitExtent(â€¦) custom projection"

I am trying to get a program of mine to run faster, but I want this to eventually be a true library port. So feel free to add suggestions to my todo list.

Here is a list of the currently supported projections.
* AziumuthalEqualArea
* AzimuthalEquiDistant
* Equirectangular
* Gnomic
* Mercator
* Orthographic
* Stereographic

A complete list of all ported projections can be found in invert-test.rs. Out of the 15 distinct projections listed only 7 have been ported so far.

## Other To-do's

<details>
<summary>See the details.</summary>

## Document API changes such as
  * src/projection/clip_angle_reset()
  * src/projection/clip_extent_clear()

Finally

todo.md contains a more detailed todo list.
